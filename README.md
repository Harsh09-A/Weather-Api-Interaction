# Weather-Api-Interaction
In this program, we have defined four functions:

get_weather_data(): This function fetches the weather data from the API and returns it as a JSON object.
get_weather_data_for_date(date): This function takes a date as input and looks for the weather data for that specific date in the JSON response. It returns the data for the specified date if found.
get_option(): This function prints the menu options and prompts the user to enter their choice. It returns the user's input.
main(): This is the main function that runs the program in a loop. It calls other functions based on the user's choice.
The program will keep running until the user selects the option to exit (0).
It allows the user to get weather information, wind speed, or pressure for a specific date based on their input.
